# Nashville Housing Project

Welcome to my SQL Data Analysis Portfolio project! This repository contains a data cleaning and EDA project made using SQL.

This project serves as a demonstration of my SQL skills for data analysis. It highlights what I've learned thus far within SQL regarding data cleaning and exploratory analysis.

## Overview

The project is divided into three complementary parts, each of which consists of SQL commands alongside comments easing the understanding of code.

- **Part 1: Data Import** - Creation of the database schema and a table fitted directly for the incoming dataset to ensure a trouble-free import.

- **Part 2: Data Cleaning ** - An in-depth process of cleaning dirty data for an upcoming analysis consisting of fixing empty values to NULLs, standardisation, rebuilding missing data, splitting, and deduplication.

- **Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis** - Fiddling with previously cleaned data in order to discover meaningful insights via methods like researching the distribution of data between columns, aggregating the data, and checking whether there exists a correlation between data in different columns. Besides comments, this part contains partial conclusions gathered from EDA.
